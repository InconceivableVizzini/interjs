# inter.js

Inter.js is intended to ease the creation of interactive javascript projects. The code is written in modern JavaScript. However, some parts of the library are more concerned with being easily understood by javascript interpreters than by developers diving into the source, so please do explore `/doc`.

A good starting point is to try `npm run test` and `npm run graph`.
